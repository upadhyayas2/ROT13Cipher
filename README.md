# ðŸ”„ ROT13 Encoder/Decoder in Java

A simple but fun project that encodes and decodes text using the **ROT13 cipher**, built with Java.

This project takes in a message and shifts each letter by 13 places in the alphabet. Itâ€™s a type of Caesar cipher where the shift is always fixed at 13. Since it's symmetric, encoding and decoding use the same logic!

## âœ¨ Features

- Encode any message using ROT13
- Decode ROT13 messages back to the original
- Works for both uppercase and lowercase letters
- Ignores non-letter characters (punctuation, numbers, etc.)
- Clean and beginner-friendly Java code

---

## Example

Input: Hello, World!
Encoded: Uryyb, Jbeyq!
Decoded: Hello, World!

## What I Learned

- How Caesar ciphers work
- Java string and character manipulation
- Writing interactive console applications
- Structuring a small but complete Java project

---

## Why This Project?

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of basic Java concepts like loops, conditionals, strings, and user input â€” all while building something practical and kind of cool! It's a great introduction to encryption logic, and it's fun to test with secret messages.
